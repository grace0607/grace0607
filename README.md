### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Grace, a student at Columbia interested in programming and its applications for social impact and policy.

ðŸ“– Past courses I took are Full Stack Web Dev, Building AI Tools, Data Structures & Algorithms, Text Analysis in Python, Infographics and Data Visualization, Intro to Computer Science/Programming in Java, and Python for Public Policy among others.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fun projects that are useful, creative, and kind!
